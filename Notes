Predict outfit
Outfit parameters:
If it has been more than 20 shows since the item was last worn, remove it from the pool of items that can be worn
Give each item a score based on how often it is worn (e.g. if there are 50 shows, and item A was worn in 30 of them, it would have a score of 30/50)
Remove a significant amount of score if the item was worn the imminently previous night, unless has been worn for 4 previous nights

multiply given score by how long it's been since item was last worn, up to a cap of the number of possible items (e.g. if 4 possible items, score would be 4x at most). this way, of items that have similar scores


Song parameters
If any song has ever been played before, -1 score, else
